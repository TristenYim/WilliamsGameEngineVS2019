In FIRST TD, you are a defense bot trying to defend an incoming wave of offense bots which are trying to score in your goal.

You use a selection box that follows your cursor to interact with the game.

To buy towers, press the number keys, select your location, and then right click to buy.
To upgrade, hover over the tower and press u.
When you hover over towers, a box is drawn showing its range.

The Cheesy Poofs tower is a rapid-firing single-target tower that has high DPS. This tower is assigned the the '1' key.
The Sonic Squirrels tower is an extremely rapid-firing tower that has shoots 3 piercing projectiles that do little damage. This tower is assigned the the '2' key.
The Bomb Squad tower is a slow-firing tower that shoots explosive bombs. This tower is assigned the the '3' key.

To start a wave, press p.
Enemies spawn from one of two entrances and immediately start making their way to the end.
When an enemy reaches the end, it will start scoring and continue until killed.
There are various kinds of enemies with different speeds, health, scoring speeds, and scoring accuracy.
At the end of a wave, you are awarded bonus credits.

The defense bot allows you to interact with the game in a way that's unrelated to the towers.
You move the defense bot with WASD and use X to block and C to ram.
Blocking prevents scoring projectiles from passing through you, however, if you block for too long, you recieve a MAJOR PENALTY.
Ramming does a small amount of damage to a single enemy. This exists to prevent an enemy from scoring indefinitely if you cannot place a tower to kill it.

To win, you must outlast all of the waves. To lose, the enemies must reach a greater score than you.
By default you have 50 score and the enemies have 0 score. Major penalties subtract 10 points from your score.
You can also recieve minor penalties for colliding with offense bots for too long.

That's basically it. You start with 75 credits. Good luck!
